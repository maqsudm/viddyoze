Test for ViddyOze
I have completed the test and added the following.

BasketService.php which is an interface which defines the methods.

BasketServiceImpl.php which is the main class which performs the operations on the basket.

BasketItem.php which represents an Item in the basket which takes a Product and the quantity as a parameter.

Product.php is what represents a Product from the catalogue and it has the parameters defined in the test doc.

I have added the test file to test scenarios mentioned in the test doc and they all work as expected.
